==="Silence"===

Talking
Why's everyone always talking?
Noise in my head
But it's nonsense
I can't feel love

Guarded
Don't overthink how we started
Knew from the second you walked in
This could be something

Everybody's looking for love to start a riot
But every time I look in your eyes
The world gets quiet

So let it go
Let it fall
Let it fly
We'll keep on trying
'Cause I knew I was in love with you
When we sat in silence

Dreaming
I'm wide awake while I'm dreaming
Seeing in your eyes what you're thinking
So please don't worry

Waiting
Know that I'll always be waiting
Do you believe what I'm saying?
I'm in no hurry

Everybody's looking for love to start a riot
But every time I look in your eyes
The world gets quiet

So let it go
Let it fall
Let it fly
We'll keep on trying
'Cause I knew I was in love with you
When we sat in silence

Sat in silence
Sat in silence
Sat in silence
When we sat in silence

Sat in silence
Sat in silence
Sat in silence
When we sat in silence

'Cause I knew I was in love with you
When we sat in silence

==="Enemy"===

[Dan Reynolds:]
(Look out for yourself)

I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around
With my ear up to the ground

I'm searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my back is to the world
That was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on the wall
As you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls
And the names that I've been called

I stack it in my mind
And I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like
To be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
(Huh)

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)

[JID:]
Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape
Thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock
To cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic, quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat

[Dan Reynolds:]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy

(I'll never be a saint, no way)
My enemy

==="Boomerang"===

How many lies do we have to tell
To keep from saying that I wish you well
How many times said I'm moving on
How many times that false alarm goes off (goes off)
Goes off (Goes off)
I know I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I'm bad at letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang

How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it out, is it worth enough?
Should we go ahead or should we turn around?
I know I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I'm bad at letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang

Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean that it is wrong
Everything that we've been working on, working on so long
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boome-boome-boome-rang

==="Lock Me Up"===

Time to listen to my confession.
I'm much less than I wanted to be, wanted to be.
You shine a light on my dark side,
But you don't care what you see.

Overjoyed over you overnight.
But that's what you do.

Why don't you lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire.
I don't want you to stop.
Lock me in and hold this moment, never get enough.
Ain't no way I'm never breaking free.
Lock me up.

Lock me up.

Criticize.
You don't analyse me
'Cause you can see what I'm trying to be, trying to be.
I've been lost
And I've been blinded
By all the things that I've seen.

Overjoyed over you overnight.
Girl, that's what you do.

So why don't you lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire.
I don't want you to stop.
Lock me in and hold this moment, never get enough.
Ain't no way I'm never breaking free.
Lock me up.

Why don't you�?
Why don't you�?
Why don't you lock me up?

Why don't you�?
Why don't you�?
Why don't you lock me up?

Overjoyed over you overnight.
Girl, that's what you do.

So why don't you lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire.
I don't want you to stop.
Lock me in and hold this moment, never get enough.
Ain't no way I'm never breaking free.
Lock me up.

Why don't you�?

Why don't you�?
Why don't you lock me up?

==="I Don't Know Why"===

We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Loving the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're living in a lie of trust

I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And were caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost it hurts
We're living in a lie of trust

I don't know why but I guess it's got something to do with you

==="Magic In The Hamptons"===

[Mikey:]
Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shades
Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
Bottle of C�roc with a hint of Kool-Aid
She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
Are you tired from running through my mind
Take a break and we can have a good time
Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
Me and you should get a room right now

'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away, you're worth more than every single chain
It ain't gonn' work if you don't want it too, best drink I take is when I sippin' you

You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm bout to smash it, it's true

I can take to the room, I can take you to the beach
But we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep
You can be that early bird, Imma get that worm
You and me, I'll take 'round the world

'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away, you're worth more than every single chain
Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool, next trip I take is just me and you

You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm bout to smash it, it's true

[Lil Yachty:]
Lil Boat
You said you lovin' up north when you comin' to the A
You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay
I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh I wanna sing
Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
Don't know if you're the one but if you are, you'll get a ring
That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
As you whip the Coupe around, use the seat belt first
New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse

[Mikey:]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you

==="Two Moons"===

Two moons, I can feel myself start catching on fire
You knew, yeah you kept it to yourself, to your self
Two moons, I get lost on my way searching for liars
This ain't good for my health, no this ain't good for my health

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My hearts been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left

Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door
I'm left with less

I don't feel serene
No, I don't feel too clean
And I don't want to be the one to make you cry
I'll play inside
I'll start a fire
I'll tell your friends
That I lost my mind
And it'll take a while
But I'll start to smile
Broken windows and
Broken tiles
Frozen willows will
Go for miles
Hope will let go
Yeah that's its style
And you don't know
Where my soul's heading
And I'm forgetting you
So I'll say

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My hearts been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left

Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door
I'm left with less

Left, right, my eye's sight is diminishing
My life sucks at night I try to finish it
Early, pearly whites get blurry
Surely I'll go bite the dirty dust
Cuts deeper as my head goes nuts
I'll be a believer if I ever see trust
I must be disgusting rust
God I hate myself
I just wanna unplug

Yeah fuck no
I go where I want to
But I'm stuck in my bedroom
I'm telling lies to keep myself from hurting those around you
Yeah after all these years, I found you
I found you
Again

Sorry please excuse me for my mess
My hearts been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left

Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door
I'm left with less
(I close my door)
(I'm left with less)
(I close my door)

[Jonah Marais:]
Stay one more night
Oh my dear, why do all the seasons change?
Over time, now we're here thinking 'bout those days

[Corbyn Besson:]
I just wish things could be like they used to
But they never will now I see right through you
Wish you could tell me all the ways that I miss you
Baby, I'd be lying if I didn't say I wish you'd

[Daniel Seavey:]
Stay, baby
I don't know, do you?
Baby, I'll try my best to forget you
But I know that I still miss you
Dancing all alone
But I can't let you go
Gave you all I could give you
Now all that's left is "I still miss you"

[Zach Herron:]
You don't love me like you used to
I can tell you don't need me when I'm with you
Girl, you don't need help
You was lying while I'm lying here by myself
But who was there when you were crying on the ground
Oh, I should probably go
I should hit the road, drop you and go
Damn, I am alone in the world
Tired of feeling down, think it's time I leave you now

[Jack Avery:]
I just wish things could be like they used to
But they never will now I see right through you

==="parachute"===

Vibing, we could talk all night or sit in silence
Watching shitty movies, getting high and
Laughing about nothing much at all
And that's cool with me

Losing control but I like it
Whatcha doin' to me, doin' to me?
You got a hold of my psyche
And that's alright with me

I don't know what's happening...

Lately I've been someone and it ain't myself
I'm spending all my time on somebody else
I'm feelin' all these feelings I don't understand
You're the one good thing I ain't questioning
Like ooh, if I knew that it would kill me
I would still be here a thousand times over
If that's the consequence of loving you
Then I would fall without a parachute

Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da
Then I would fall without a parachute
Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da

Fingers wrapped around me
And I'm thinkin three words
Got me thinkin' diamonds
And I usually take my time
I just can't believe it
All the ways that you blow my mind
Everyone can see it

Lately I've been someone and it ain't myself
I'm spending all my time on somebody else
I'm feelin' all these feelings I don't understand

==="Heartless"===

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told

Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told

Broad street
Yeah, we met over sake
Might have started off rocky
And ruined our first date

But last night
When you finally called me
I ran straight through the lobby
I couldn't keep you waiting

And I know and I know and I know and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Do you mind if I see you tomorrow?

Yea I know yea I know yea I know yea I know
That you work sundays for minimum wage
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now would you think it through?

Hey
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it ok if I stay 'cause I'm dying to?
Yea I'm dying to

Restless
Tangled up in your mattress
In the morning we'll get dressed
The one that got away

You caught me
Yea I'm right where you want me
Every inch of my body
Won't let this go to waste

And I know and I know and I know and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate

Are you okay?
'Cause you're the one who needed space
And finally now I'm doing fine
You would rather see me cry
Are you okay?
You're acting like we never changed
And finally I can sleep at night
Makes you wanna lose your mind

I know that you've been scared of love
And everything it did to us
But how am I supposed to open up?
When you were just so good at closing off
You're up and down, I'm inside out
You ripped my heart right from my mouth
And then I had to go and pick it up
And play it like I didn't give a fuck

You called up my phone 50 times from that party
3am, you thought I'd be there in a heartbeat
It's your life but you might wanna put down the Bacardi
Mean this sincerely dude

Are you okay?
'Cause you're the one who needed space
And finally now I'm doing fine
You would rather see me cry

You're acting like we never changed
And finally I can sleep at night
Makes you wanna lose your mind

You called my friends, you called my Dad
You begged for help to win me back
And they would never say it to your face
But no, they never liked you anyways
You missed my birthday and my shows
You made me feel so damn alone
And somehow now you got so much to say
Don't got time to listen anyway

You called up my phone 50 times from that party

We have fears
Shed tears
And we carry our mistakes
It's funny when you're down and out they don't come around
They don't come around, oh
It's funny when you're down and out they don't make a sound

I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Where you gonna be when the money run low?

I've been high
The good life
It's good until it fades
But when you come down
The cold ground's gonna put you in your place
Gotta count my blessings
Try to pay it forward
Somehow always end up going back
Always learning everything the hard way

I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?

The money run low
The money run low
The money run low, oh, oh, oh yeah
The money run low
The money run low
The money run low, oh, oh

I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money run low?

I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Where you gonna be when the money run low?

==="Kills You Slowly"===

Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman
Got drunk again, before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you
You're tired of me, I knew you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in LouisVuittons
And fucked em up, you know that they're my favorite

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Arguments that never end
You're talkin shit, to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are starting to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walked into your parents'
Then you put on that smile again
And grabbed my hand, even though you hate it

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
(Hold it, even though it kills you slowly)
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
(Explosions, hidden when we're in the open)
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
(Keep on smiling, until it's over)
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
(Hold it, even though it kills you slowly)
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

[Beyonc�:]
Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
That I shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That I shoot across the sky

[Coldplay:]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Coldplay & Beyonc�:]
You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Coldplay:]
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Woo!

[Coldplay & Beyonc�:]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

[Coldplay & Beyonc�:]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Coldplay:]
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Beyonc� & Coldplay:]
I, oh, I, oh, I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high
I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Beyonc� & Coldplay:]
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Watch me shoot across the..
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...

==="Losing you"===
Yeah, I don't know if I should tell you
Every little thing about the way I feel, 'bout the way I feel
Caught in this new dimension
Seeing things being misdirected in between the lines
So much confusion in your eyes
Oh, you know I've been thinking nonstop
About all the ways this could go wrong, oh my God
And I know I just don't wanna give up
I just can't seem to see myself with someone else
Oh, 'cause I can't
Seem to picture losing you
Maybe you can see right through it
And maybe I just look real stupid
When I pretend I don't feel anything
Remember going to the market
And holding hands like it was nothing
Did it feel wrong? I think not
And you know I've been stressing nonstop
'Bout all the ways this could go wrong, oh my God
And I know I don't just wanna give up
I just can't seem to see myself with someone else
Oh, 'cause I can't
Seem to picture losing you

==="Love me like you do"===

You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)

==="Peanut Butter Waffles"===

I'm always singing 'bout my fickle feelings 'cause there ain't no antidote
Laying here in silence 'cause I cannot find the damn remote
Even if I found it I would probably just flip flip and flip
In the midst of August getting started on my Christmas list
I been thinking about you and I wanna go do something nice
I can't take rejection and that's why I pay the crazy price
If you ain't ecstatic I feel like I blew it big time
I'm a little manic, I just wanna see your big smile
Nothing means more to me than when I hear that you're proud of me
Acting like a kid because I never quite learned how to be
Peanut butter waffles when it's dinner time and I'm alone
Hiding in my castle but the walls are made of styrofoam

I know
There's no in between, it's either high, low
You know how to balance but I don't
I wish I could finally just find home
I know
There's no in between, it's either high, low
You know how to balance but I don't
I wish I could finally just find home

I'm drinking coffee at 3 AM playing Battlegrounds and Overwatch
Volume up to 50 'cause it get too trippy if it's not
I can hear the fridge buzz, I can hear my thoughts clear
I can hear the room ring, I can hear who's not here
I let my little bro talk me into buying designer clothes
He tell me I'm flexing but I don't even feel kinda close
Them bitches were brand new, but they look like old shoes
Coulda bought a puppy or 220 cold brews
When somebody ask me how I been I get too personal
Catching up and small talk are two things I never learned to do
I make life decisions in the time it take to brush my teeth
Can't remember where I been, don't know where I'm gonna be

I know
There's no in between, it's either high, low
You know how to balance but I don't
I wish I could finally just find home
I know
There's no in between, it's either high, low
You know how to balance but I don't
I wish I could finally just find home

==="Parents"===

Blah!

I was born in a messed up century
My favourite flavoured sweets are raspberry amphetamines
I bought a car, Beretta aged sixteen
I brush my teeth with bleach 'cause I ain't got time for cavities
My daddy put a gun to my head, said if you kiss a boy I'm gonna shoot you dead
So I tied him up with gaffer tape
And I locked him in a shed
Then I went out to the garden
And I fucked my best friend cause my

High hopes are getting low because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive, cause parents ain't always right

Drop a toaster in my bath watch my mum and dad laugh
See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had
They told me casual affection leads to sexual infection
But it's hard to get an erection when you're so used to rejection
Yeah the teacher fucked the preacher
But then he had to leave her
Had to wash away the sins
Of a male cheerleader
Hi, nice to meet ya, got nothing to believe in
So let me know when my breathing stops
Cause my

High hopes are getting low because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive, cause parents ain't always right

Tick, tock, stop the clock
Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot
Tick, tock, stop the clock
Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot

My high hopes are getting low because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried I would never know
High hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive, cause parents ain't always right

==="No One Can Fix Me"===

They say that cigarettes can kill
They say to stay away from pills
That too much liquor makes you ill
But no one warned me about you
No one warned me about you

They say that drugs will melt your mind
I've heard that talk a million times
I've always followed warning signs
But there were none in front of you
No one warned me about you

You're gonna send me to the ER
With the things you do to my heart
They could give me all the stitches
But part of me is missing
It's you, you, ooh
It's you

And, oh, my heart breaks
When you keep your distance
I get headaches
It's just one of the symptoms
I'm a rare case
And nobody knows what to do
(Nobody knows what to do)
'Cause no one can fix me but you

Last night I think I dreamt of you
Woke up with tons of black and blues
I swear to God my heart is bruised
And I don't know what I should do
I don't know what I should do

You're gonna send me to the ER
With the things you do to my heart
They could give me all the stitches
But part of me is missing
It's you, you, ooh
It's you

And, oh, my heart breaks
When you keep your distance
I get headaches
It's just one of the symptoms
I'm a rare case

Just you tonight
That's the only thing I wanna do tonight
I'ma put that body in a tomb tonight
And we gon' take a trip to where you lose your mind
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh

I can't breathe in between these sheets
In too deep and I'm already drowning
Tropical rain and it's all on me
In so deep and your love is surrounding
I can't breathe in between these sheets
In too deep and I'm already drowning
Tropical rain and it's all on me
In so deep and your love is surrounding

You're the moon tonight
So I'ma throw a lasso around you tonight
Don't know 'bout the things you wanna do tonight
Just show up wearing nothing but your shoes tonight

Swimming in paradise
When your body's on mine

I can't breathe in between these sheets
In too deep and I'm already drowning
Tropical rain and it's all on me
In so deep and your love is surrounding
I can't breathe in between these sheets
In too deep and I'm already drowning
Tropical rain and it's all on me
In so deep and your love is surrounding

I can't breathe in between these sheets
In too deep and I'm already drowning
Tropical rain and it's all on me

The precipice, born to change
The final days, the last appraise
Augustus, Nero, takin' names

I'm high then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun (Hey)
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)

You give your life, no other way

To wear the crown, rise up from the ground

Stop, then I go, go

How many lessons never learned?
How many artists fear the light,
Fear the pain, go insane?
Lose the mind, lose yourself

Sellout, sellout, SELLOUT

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come

==="Goodbye"===

I was a hot mess
In my Sunday best
Black tears in my eyes

You were my first love
You were my only one
I can't believe your lies

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it
Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

You got a new friend
You like to play pretend
I'm just keepin' my cool

Turn on that smoke machine
Magic and make-believe
She'll never know you like I do

Once we were a fire burnin'
Now you're just a lesson I'm learnin'
Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

[4x]
I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it
Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Losin' my mind

==="Fixed"===

I'm a shipwreck waiting for you
You're the rock that stopped me going
Anywhere, anywhere
Going anywhere, anywhere

You're the storm that took me under
Before I knew it was you
I was already going down, going down
I was going down, going down

Anytime that you leave
I find it hard just to breathe
I come apart in every way
You never put me back again

Every time you go I come a little undone
Even when it hurts, I'm holding on to your love
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you
And you can walk away but I could never let go
Don't know how you did it but I'm set in stone
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you

I'll be here if you ever come calling
By the ocean I'm a ghost of everything, everything
That we ever did, ever did
You got me caught, got me hooked, got me fixed up
You got me chained but I wouldn't wanna change for anything, anything
Not for anything, anything

Anytime that you leave
I find it hard just to breathe
I come apart in every way
You never put me back again

Every time you go I come a little undone
Even when it hurts, I'm holding on to your love
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you
And you can walk away but I could never let go
Don't know how you did it but I'm set in stone
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you

Stuck standing on a cliff
It's the way you get your kicks
Ain't the way I wanna live
But that's the way you got me fixed

Stuck standing on a cliff
It's the way you get your kicks
Ain't the way I wanna live
But that's the way you got me fixed

Ain't the way I wanna live

Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed (holding on)
You got me fixed on you

Don't know how you did it but I'm set in stone

==="Whatever It Takes"===

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of them
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

==="Ophelia"===

Ah, ah, when I was younger, I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse, and you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend, he feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse, and you can't see past my blinders

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help the fool who falls in love

I, I got a little paycheck, you got big plans and you gotta move
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

"Honey, I love you," that's all she wrote

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help the fool who falls in love

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help the fool who falls in love

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help the fool who falls in love

==="Do I Wanna Know?"===

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?

==="COMPLETE MESS"===

Caught up in heaven but your heaven ain't the same
And I've never been a saint, have I?
This evanescence always fleeting like a flame
But I'm never one to change, am I?
Call it a lesson when I feel you slide away
And I'm missing out on half my life

Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess
Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess

Hang on to moments like they'll never drift away
'Cause you'll never get to say goodbye
I ask no questions as your colours take their hold
As my darkness turns to gold inside
I learned my lesson when I felt you slip away
And I'm missing out on half my life

Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess
Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess

(You make me a complete mess)
(You make me a complete mess)

Caught up in heaven but your heaven ain't the same
But I've never been a saint, have I?

Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete (You make me complete)
You make me a complete mess
Oh, you make me complete (You make me complete)
You make me complete (You make me complete)
You make me a complete mess

==="Yellow"===

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

==="The One"===

You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I arrive
I count the seconds

Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

(You know, I'm sorry)
(I'm sorry)
No, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

==="Meant To Be"===

When I cook, you do the dishes
And when I'm working late, you record the game
So I don't miss it
And we're good at taking on each other's issues
But we're bleeding through the bandaids
And we're crying through the tissues
And it's kind of romantic
How overdramatic we are
And it's got us this far

But I think you're the one for someone else
And that shit's hard to say
It's okay, you feel the same and I can tell
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last

And I don't wanna keep you waiting
It's not as simple as a yes or no
It's kinda complicated
But I would leave a five-star review, ten out of ten
Recommend you to a friend if I could

'Cause I think you're the one for someone else
And that shit's hard to say
It's okay, you feel the same and I can tell
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, not made to last
'Cause we put too much pressure on ourselves
Keeping up appearances to please everybody else
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, just not meant to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last

==="Hard Boy"===

Sometimes I think I want a bad boy
Wake up like, "Woop!", not a good choice
I should've taken my mom's advice
(Wait a second, my mom's texting me)
One girlfriend left you with a heart sore
Look at you, suddenly you're so hardcore
Oh, does that make you feel big inside?

Got a heart tattoo on your chest
But there's nothing inside
But I told you
Too cool for love typically ain't my type

'Cause you think you're such a hard boy, baby
And that's just the things I'm into lately
I know I won't feel this way come tomorrow
So let's see how hard, how hard you actually are
When I leave

Who hurt you and made you so guarded?
Throwing dishes on the floor of my apartment
Took a pic just to show it off to your friends
How come nobody calling at five in the morning
'Cause you don't leave outta New Orleans
Back of your pickup, I wasn't busy
One day I will be

Got a heart tattoo on your chest
But there's nothing inside
But I told you
Too cool for love typically ain't my type

'Cause you think you're such a hard boy, baby
And that's just the things I'm into lately
I know I won't feel this way come tomorrow
So let's see how hard, how hard you actually are
When I leave

'Cause you think you're such a hard boy, baby
And that's just the things I'm into lately

'Cause you think you're such a hard boy, baby
And that's just the things I'm into lately
I know I won't feel this way come tomorrow
So let's see how hard, how hard you actually are
When I leave

I, I
When I leave
I, I leave
So let's see how hard, how hard you actually are
When I leave

==="See The Way"===

I go from okay, I'm okay to I'm not okay in point two
I go from cool in my new place to packing my suitcase like you
I said it over and over that I wouldn't do this
Go find someone new and just fuck my way through this
But no way or no way I'm okay when thinking about you

You were right when you said it
Keep my cards to my chest and I never let no one know me
I pushed you out
Now, I get that you needed
Just a little more love and to just see me wide open and breaking down

When no one's there to listen I will heal your pain
I know that I was less than but you know people change
So, tell me what's the difference if we still feel the same
It takes a little distance to make you see the way

Deleted your photos, I know what I thought it would do
And I know what you're thinking that's never something I would do
I wish I could lie but I'm so not a liar
Been trying and I try to pretend that I'm fine but I
Just end up lying, yeah, feeling more than I want to

You were right when you said it
Keep my cards to my chest and I never let no one know me
I pushed you out
Now, I get that you needed
Just a little more love and to just see me wide open and breaking down

When no one's there to listen I will heal your pain
I know that I was less than but you know people change
So, tell me what's the difference if we still feel the same
It takes a little distance to make you see the way

==="Youngblood"===

Remember the words you told me? "Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything 'cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby, now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah, you beat me at my own damn game

You push and you push and I'm pulling away, pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take, give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah I need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh

Lately our conversations end like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk and calls about a hundred times
So who you been calling baby? Nobody could take my place
When you're looking at those strangers, hope to God you see my face

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah I need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh

You push and you push and I'm pulling away, pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take, give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away, running away from you
Mm, from you

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life

Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight

==="Bad Kind Of Butterflies"===

Come here and sit next to me
Don't look at me while I'm breaking
After what I'm gonna say
I understand if you hate me

What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?

I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head and I, and I

I know I said we were friends
And when I said that, I meant it (Swear I meant it)
Somewhere between now and then
It became more than just a friendship

What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?

I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head and I, and I

Come here and sit next to me
You tell me baby, just say it (Say it, say it)
Warning me, it's a mistake
I just know I gotta make it

And I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
There's somebody stuck in my head and I, and I

==="Lowkey"===

Wonder what I'll do
When the cops come through
And the whiskey's run out
'Cause I've been looking at you
Since half past two
Wanna take this downtown
This liquid courage
Got me way too honest
Put your phone on vibrate
Let's catch a vibe babe
While the sun's down

Hush now, I know
We're a little too fucked up to stay still love
Be as quiet as you can
'Cause if anyone sees they'll just blow shit up
I don't gotta know if you're taken
I'll just let you know, bedroom's vacant
No one's gotta know, just us and the moon
Till the sun starts waking

Up's the only direction I see
As long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, lowkey
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, love me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Us in a king sized, keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, lowkey

Wizard with words, tellin' me
My energy's so bewitching
So I'll go first
There's an open bar
Let's close this distance
Oh-oh-oh, my
Don't make me have to spell it all night

I don't really give a fuck
'Bout all the "he said, she said" bullshit
So pick your poison love
Let's go somewhere a little more exclusive
Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand boy
Tension so intense like an asteroid
Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids

Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems
As long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, lowkey
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, love me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Us in a king sized, keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, lowkey

==="Moon"===

It's so fake, this world of ours.
More satellites than shooting stars; they're all around.
Yeah, their broken hearts on the boulevard,
You know this world'll leave you scarred and let you down.

[Pre-chorus 1:]
But leaving here with you, what a view, we'll be living on the dark side.
Yeah, right here, right now, we'll leave this crowded room.

[Chorus:]
I'll take your body to the moon.
Then I'll let you turn it around.
Girl, let's show me something new.
Let me watch you take it off now.
Baby, we don't need these lights,
'Cause you'll be seeing stars tonight.
I'll take your body to the moon.
Let's fly.
Let's fly.

Let's not complicate the night.
Just look up, everything is black and white.
If universe is you and I,
Then I know everything is gonna be alright.

[Pre-chorus 2:]
So tell me, what do you have to lose?
Don't you let this moment pass you by.
Yeah, right here, right now, we'll leave this crowded room.

==="Diamond Heart"===

Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

(If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station is playing our song

Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You can shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

(If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

La-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la

Follow the Evergreen
Look at the other leaves on the ground
You can rely on me
Now, now
Not asking for anything
We can afford to leave this town
The forest for the trees
A way out, out
We are calling
I wonder can you hear me now
Yeah we are falling
Like Thunder when we hit the ground
Well the leaves that fall in winter
Never really make a sound
Let em sleep, to dream
You're the Evergreen
Life is a mystery
Holy the water, higher the ground
Could you be a friend to me
Throughout, out
Well you tried everything
Only to better me somehow
Your not the enemy
Well I'm proud
We are calling
I wonder can you hear me now
Yeah we are falling
Like Thunder when we hit the ground
Well the leaves that fall in winter
Never really make a sound
Let em sleep, to dream
You're the Evergreen
Oh-ooh, Oh-ooh
Ohh- oh, Oh-ooh

Never really make a sound
Let em sleep, Evergreen


==="Never Going Back"===

Shrug us off our shoulders
We don't do what they told us
So I don't wanna be another face in the crowd
So I can't slow it down, no
So I can't slow it down, no
They write us off and say it's just another opinion
I'm tired of trying to fit in when I'm one in a million
So I can't slow it down, no
No I can't slow it down, no

I'm never gonna follow
Just because they say so
I'm never gonna let go, let go
Of this high

I've already hit the low, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've already felt the cold, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack
Never giving in, never going back
Already fell below, oh, oh, oh, oh
I fell deeper than the snow, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack
I'm never giving in, never going back

Don't tell me that it's over when I'm just getting started
I'm done with waiting for them 'cause my ship has departed
And I can't slow it down, no
No I can't slow it down, no

I'm never gonna follow
Just because they say so
I'm never gonna let go, let go
They won't win this fight

I've already hit the low, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've already felt the cold, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack
Never giving in, never going back
Already fell below, oh, oh, oh, oh

Never giving up, never gonna crack
Oh, oh

I'm never gonna follow
Just because they say so
I'm never gonna let go, let go

Cause I've already hit the low, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've already felt the cold, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm never giving up, never gonna crack
Never giving in, never going back
Already fell below, oh, oh, oh, oh

==="Lonely"===

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely

Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it
I'm starting to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, taking it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, and day in a life
Mixing it up, checking it twice

Trying to breath, starting to seize
Lights camera action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, oh love

Sometimes I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me
So I'm playing a role, riding the boat, stuck in a hole
Taking a bow, looking so proud
Look at me now talking about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?

Trying to breath, starting to seize
Lights camera action and scene
Story of my life, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

I said, "Oh, love" (Keep me company, I said, I need the company)
(I said, I need the company) Have mercy
(I said, I need the company, I said, oh love)
Oh, love, can you please have mercy?
(Keep me company, I said, I need the company)
(I said, I need the company) Can you keem me company?
(I said, I need the company)
Oh love, any help
Why am I so lonely?

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, oh love

==="Strawberries & cigarettes"==
Remember when we first met?
You said "light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mom and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Remember when you taught me fate
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

And even if I run away
And give my heart a holiday
Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you
You
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

Headlights, on me (And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool (And give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans (You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool (I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

But here you are

There's no touch or feeling
Pleasure or pain
Anything like the way you're runnin' through my veins
No breath or beauty
No sound or sight
That ever made me feel the way you do tonight

I just can't take my eyes off you
Tell me anything you wanna do

Nothing I can do about it
Nothing I can do about it

Out of the seven billion people in this world, there's only you
Almost a million words that I could say, but none of them will do
So many years that I have lived, but it feels like I've just begun
Out of the seven billion people, baby, you're the only one

I've been too many places. I've seen too many faces
I wrote too many pages; never found a love like you (Love like you)
I don't know how to say it. It's been more than amazing
My whole life, I've been waiting; never found a love like you (Love like you)

Sleep, dream, you, repeat. Live, die next to me
Sleep, dream, you, repeat. Sleep, dream

You were unexpected, when our lips connected
I was resurrected; never found a love like you (love like you)
Don't care where I'm headed when the world is ending
'cause you are my heaven; never found a love like you (love like you)

You did the unthinkable
Yeah, you are my miracle

==="Moral Of The Story"===

So I never really knew you
God I really tried to
Blindsided, addicted
Thought we could really do this
But really I was foolish
Hindsight it's obvious

Talking with my lawyer
She said where'd you find this guy
I said young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
Remember how we painted our house
Just like my grandparents did
So romantic but we fought the whole time
Should have seen the signs yeah

Talking with my mother
She said where'd you find this guy
Said some people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

==="Stitches"===

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head

Gonna wind up dead

Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help (begging, "Baby, please.")
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Uh, uh, 'cause I can't sleep without you
No I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you
Insomnia

I've been out for 2 days
Tylenol PM ain't workin'
Losing track of time babe

My mind is runnin' too fast
The shadows on the wall keep lurkin'
I wish that you would come back
(Insomnia)

I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Baby, it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossing and turning, tossing and turning
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
(I got, I got, I got)

Insomnia-a

Keeping me awake 'til morning
Can see you with the lights out
(Insomnia)

I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Maybe it's only been one night
Feels like it's been like a week
Tossing and turning, tossing and turning
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains

Just before I go
Yes I know that I'm losing control and
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacin'
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facin'
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

Standin' on your front porch, sayin' "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild, sayin' "Just go home and..."

Cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high
Stay fresh, play nice
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

Always sayin' that you read my sign and
Always wishin' that I'd take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black and white
I know that's not what you would like
But that's all I know
I put my mind in cruise control

Standin' on your front porch, sayin' "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild, sayin' "Just go home and..."

Cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high
Stay fresh, play nice
So just, cool out
'Cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

All the things that you detest in me
They keep you comin' back for more you see
We make each other get a bit crazy
But you will always be a part of me

Cool out

So just, cool out

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims

Integrity, faith and crocodile tears

They had tongues like guns
I had nowhere to run
Yeah, this world can get so lonely
Yeah, the paper and pen
Were my two best friends
'Cause the sad songs understood me

The irony and all my dreams were keeping me from sleeping
'Cause there�s something so fun being young and being dumb
'Cause you�re not afraid of feeling

Yeah, all of my demons are kicking and screaming but I�ll never leave them behind
Yeah, maybe I�m crazy but don�t try to save me 'cause I�ve never felt so alive

Yeah, when they knock you down, down, down
Kid, you gotta stand up (stand up), stand up (stand up)
Yeah, when they gotcha down, down, down
Gotta make your own luck (own luck), own luck (own luck)

Yeah, this world can cut you open
But all the scars they prove
That I fought my way through
So, I always keep 'em showing

'Cause sanity is suicide
And crazy are the legends
But, yeah, I'd rather have fun
Being young and being dumb
Than be saved a spot in heaven

Yeah, all of my demons are kicking and screaming but I�ll never leave them behind

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

Oh baby

Take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess
Got so aggressive

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over

This party's shit, wish we could dip
Go anywhere but here
Don't take a hit, don't kiss my lips
And please don't drink more beer

I'ma crawl out the window now
'Cause I don't like anyone around
Kinda hope you're following me out
But this is definitely not my crowd

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'till the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober

(Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
(Wish you were so, wish you were so, wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober

Trip down the road, walking you home
You kiss me at your door
Pulling me close, beg me stay over
But I'm over this roller-coaster

I'ma crawl out the window now
Getting good at saying, "gotta bounce"
Honestly you always let me down
And I know we're not just hanging out

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'till the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober

==="Unstoppable"===

There's a moment
In your bones when
When the fire takes over
Blood is running
Heart is pumping
As the battle gets closer
Ooh, they can say what they want now
Ooh, cause we'll be screaming out

We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies
Standing on top like a champion
Keep your silver, give me that gold
You'll remember when I say
We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
Cause we're unstoppable

Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable

Every spotlight
Every sound byte
Everybody who gave up
Is just the fuel for
Wanting it more
Than anybody against us
Ooh, they can say what they want now
Ooh, cause we'll be screaming out

We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies
Standing on top like a champion
Keep your silver, give me that gold
You'll remember when I say
We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
Cause we're unstoppable

Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable

Ooh, they can say what they want now
Ooh, cause we'll be screaming out

We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies
Standing on top like a champion
Keep your silver, give me that gold
You'll remember when I say
We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
We're unstoppable

==="With You"===

No, I'm not feeling like myself
I feel like I've been someone else with you (with you, with you, with you)
Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)

I feel like a lunatic, is it hard to tell?
I know that you know the stakes
You know me so well, so, so well, oh, so well
I don't wanna treat you like this every single night
Texting you, "I'm sorry" every morning, it's not right
That's not me, baby, I'm not me lately

Half of me is not enough of me to give
'Cause something's missing, but I just don't know what it is

All I know is that I'm not feeling like myself
I feel like I've been someone else with you (with you, with you, with you)
Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)

Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)

Know I'd need some clarity, shit we just ignore
What's the point of honesty if it just hurts us more?
I'm not sure, baby, I'm at war
I don't wanna be the guy your parents want
That's exactly what I feel like, feel like I've become
That's not me, baby, I'm not me lately

Half of me is not enough of me to give

Pretty face with pretty bad dreams
No one knows I cry in my sleep
Waking up feeling like shit

I don't care

Never go outside

I just want to disappear (depression)

There's so much time to question my life

It's my

My worst habit

So I stay up all night
Wondering why I'm so tired all the time

All my friends are doing things
It's good for them
But I'm nothing

==="Londons song"====
Sweeter in the morning
When I look at your face
I love you
Oh my little daughter
You're the meaning of grace
I love you
And i'm like ohhh
Take a little piece of my heart
Talking in your sleep
I wonder what you're dreaming up, dear
And if the world don't keep you warm
There's a blanket of stars above you
And i'm like ohhh
Take another little piece of my heart
Ohhh, Ohhh
If this is where you'll always wanna be
Then leave your tank on e
There's a place we can go
Where you look at the light and it splinters
Where there's plenty of gas to last us
Through the cold, cold winter
And i'm like ohhh
Take whatever's left of my heart
Ohhh, Ohhh
If this is where you'll always wanna be
Then leave your tank on e
I will love you tender
I will love you more
I will love you forever, more
Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh
If this is where you'll always wanna be
Then leave your tank on e
This is where you'll always wanna be
In the sunshine standing next to me
This is where you'll always wanna be
In the sunshine standing next to me

Crush, who's got a crush?
I like the way you blush
I like the way you bite
Touch, each time we touch
I wanna take too much
Keep me up all night

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?
Stick and poke tattoo?
You wanna play my new girl?
I wanna play with you

Cash, got hard earned cash
I like the way you crash
Your lips into mine
Fast, we drive too fast
We got a checkered past
But I can let it slide

I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?

Ain't it fun, remember it?

So hard to find this place
So hard to catch this chase
Now that you fell into me
Hit me like a melody
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh

Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So while I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever

How do we make this heartbeat on and on?

Hold me like a photograph
Fragile like a piece of glass

The future is headed for the past
Full of sparks that couldn't last

So hard to find this place
So hard to catch that flame

Hit me like a melody

I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Wishing I could paint my scars and make me whole

See the devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
And my love, I won't give up
So my love, please don't give up

==="Ghost Of You"===

Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side
There's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time
If I could dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with this shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

Cleaning up today, found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt
We're too young, too dumb, to know things like love
But I know better now, better now

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with this shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

(Fine)
Too young, too dumb
(Fine)
To know things like love
(Fine)
Too young, too dumb
(Fine)

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with this shot of truth
That my feet don't dance like they did with you

We got the love in our blood now, yeah
Feels like we're coming up now, yeah
Drowning in a pool of people
Now all I ever see is you

You pull me back like nobody, nobody could
I try but I can't fight the feeling
Feels like dreaming

So give me that summertime
Sweet like caramel
The way that you get me high
Is something like, something like chemicals
Something like, something like chemicals

Something like, something like

Bungee-jumping out a jet plane
Adrenaline state of mind
Superpowers, I'm all Bruce Wayne
It's a feeling that I kinda like

Yeah, the way you got me free-falling
Make me wanna cash a cheque all in
Every time I got you with me
I'm feeling like I lose my mind

You pull me back like nobody, nobody could
I try but I can't fight the feeling
Feels like dreaming

So give me that summertime

So here we are
Like we were
Two feet apart
In different worlds
No need to say
Another word
No, I should leave
But I don't wanna go just yet
'Cause I'm not really over it

You remind my heart
Of a lie I wish you never told
But it's all I've got
Just five more minutes and I'm gone
Same old song like an echo, ooh
'Cause I know I'm better off alone
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go

Now that I know the way it ends
The words we chose, irrelevant
Let's just pretend a little bit
I know I should leave but
I don't wanna go just yet
'Cause I'm not really over it

You remind my heart (You remind my heart)
Of a lie I wish you never told
But it's all I've got (All I've got)
Just five more minutes and I'll go
(Five more minutes and I'll go)

It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go

Just five more minutes and I'll go

==="Cheating On You"===

It started with a kiss on your momma's couch
2012 was nothin' serious
And then we caught the feels, it got really real
Too good to be true, I guess I thought you was, yeah

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky, shouldn't have did you wrong
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away
Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

I said goodbye
And you said goodbye

==="Water Fountain"===
She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain
She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young

I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young
I was too young

Too young, too young, too young, young

And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
The handle will be broken and the rust set in
But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it

Now I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And I know that it's only a wish
And that we're not standing by the water fountain

Too young, too young, too young, young

She couldn't be at home in the night time
Because it made her feel alone
But at that time she was too young
I was too young

I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young
I was too young

Too young, too young, too young, young

(Too young, too young, too young, young)

I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young
I was too young

==="fuck u, goodluck"===

Was it really just me?
Did you really feel nothin' at all?
If you hated the way I bothered you
Then what can I say to that?

And I can't fall asleep
'Cause I know that you follow my dreams
Every step you take away from me
You're deeper in my chest

No one compares
Nothin' compares
I've never loved and loved so deeply
But how the hell could I argue a "no"?

'Cause you'll never change
For anyone's sake
I could've gave, and paid, and saved, and killed
But I guess no is a no

Give it a year or two
And I'll be over you
I'll be blamin' me, "oh stupid me"
"Haha fuck my life"

Shed a tear or two
For the heart I gave to you
Hope you learned how not to break a heart
So fuck you, and good luck too

I just followed my heart
But it turned, and it shredded apart
And I'm mad, and so embarrassed
I'm scared that I'll never love again

And I can't fall asleep
'Cause I hate that I'm nothin' alone
"Love yourself, be confident" they say
But you were my confidence

No one compares
Nothin' compares
I've never loved and loved so deeply
But how the hell could I argue a "no"?

Cause I'll never change
So used to the pain
But shouldn't you take some blame for making me love you at all?

Give it a year or two
And I'll be over you
I'll be blamin' me, "oh stupid me"
"Haha fuck my life"

Shed a tear or two
For the heart I gave to you
Hope you learned how not to break a heart
So fuck you, and good luck too

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Give it a year or two
And I'll be over you
I'll be blamin' me, "oh stupid me"
"Haha fuck my life"

Shed a tear or two
For the heart I gave to you
Hope you learned how not to break a heart
So fuck you, and good luck too

==="Cold / mess"===

When i feel cold
I'll keep you close
And if i could hold you
And take you home
When at night
Your toes touch mine
I'll sing you to sleep
If you were mine to keep
I wish i could leave you my love
But my heart, is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath.
To sway just like
It was friday night
And all the lights
Will blind me dry
My lullaby
Is your sigh
And i can feel it
When you cry
I wish i could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath.
When i feel cold
I keep you close
And if i could hold you
And take you home

==="Real Life"===

She says that the world is a broken mess
It's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Every single time

And no, I cannot fix it
No, I cannot make it stop
So I said...

Turn your phone off, only look me in my eye
Can we live that real life, real life? Oh hey
Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can we live that real life, real life?

She prays on her knees as the towers' fall
To a god she does not know
She's beggin' him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs blow (Ooh)
She says, "How could I, oh, ever believe
In somethin' that would step aside and watch?"
And I got no words to say
'Cause I think I lost my faith
But I fake it for the day
Oh, everything will be okay

But no, I cannot fix it
And I cannot make it stop
So I said...

Turn your phone off, only look me in my eye
Can we live that real life, real life? Oh hey
Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can we live that real life, real life?

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold to
The only thing that's real to me is
You

Turn your phone off, only look me in my eye
Can we live that real life, real life? Oh hey
Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can we live that real life, real life? Oh hey
(Real life, hey)
Real life, real life, oh hey
Real life, real life, oh hey

==="I Wanna Be Yours"===

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I won't ever rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
And let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (I wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours...

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I won't ever rust
I just wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours

==="IDGAF"===

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (Get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

==="You Broke Me First"===

You broke me first, ah

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took awhile, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

You broke me first
(You broke me first)
You broke me first, ah

==="Rolling In The Deep"===

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat

But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat.

==="Peer Pressure"===

Seven texts, 2AM
Halfway dressed, they're all saying call me up
You can't sleep, you're testing me
Bad but sweet and I'm just tryna keep it together
Oh and now you're sayin'

Put your hands on my body just like you think you know me
Want your heart beating on me, don't leave me hot and lonely
I don't usually give in to peer pressure
But I'll give in to yours

When we met, innocent
Now I'm dead everytime you're touchin' me

You're dancing around on my mind every second
I'm under control 'til you're in front of me
Maybe I'm scared, I don't care, I'm addicted
I'm in it

Want your heart beating on me, don't leave me hot and lonely

Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouth full of toothpaste
Before I got to know you

Hung up high in the gallery
Out of this shade (Sunflower, sunflower)

Your flowers just died
Plant new seeds in the melody

Tell me can you see me now?
While you were busy lost in the crowd
I was busy making myself
Into someone free from doubts
I was down and left on the shelf
I wanted a story to tell

I scream it to the people started calling
Singing words that came from all the fallen
Down, down
Now, now

It's time to breakout
So everybody just scream out

I'm the only one
No chains, no chains won't make me break down
And I can finally see now
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
No chains, no chains won't hold me down

Tell me how it feels to know
I'm not a puppet under control
I cut the strings a long time ago, oh
I guess that I should thank you though
Cause all you was the fire for my soul
And now I'm up here running the show

Singing words that came from all the fallen

You say that you've been missing me
Every single time we're not together
And I know that I've been gone from everything
But I needed that
Say you wish that you were kissing me
It comes outta nowhere, whenever
But I'm kinda sick and tired, you're so selfish
Say that I'm not coming back to you

But wait, don't leave
Hate that it's so easy for you
Wait, I can't see
Try to walk away

I keep falling for the bad ones
The always-make-me-sad ones
Trying hard to hold my ground
But it always ties me down, yeah, the bad ones
Way too good at falling for the bad ones

You're really good at tricking me
Making me believe I'm not enough
And I'm always so confident
Till you come and trip me up
Why you so caught up with fixing me?
You know that's something that I really hate
You're the only thing about me that should change
You're my one mistake

Care about the cars and the fast life, go
Only one star to align right now
Wishing, yeah, I'm wishing you were mine right now
Don't you feel a problem? I feel it too, yeah
Don't need another one when I got you
You're dancing with another man and that's cool

I guess that I forgot to tell you
That I can't get you outta my mind
Your love has got me blind

Baby, this ain't no game

'Cause I still believe that you could be my rock 'n' roll

She decorates her room like a raven
She got a whole draw full of diamonds
She talk about her exes and the money
She talks about 'em, she brags about 'em
She rants about 'em on and on and on and on and on
She always get her drinks for free
Never, ever think of me

I guess that I forgot to tell you
That I can't get you outta my mind
Your love has got me blind

==="Walking The Wire"===

Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around and we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling then don't look down
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had to just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry but those tears will fade
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes
Love

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

We're walking the wire

We're walking the wire, wire, wire

==="This Feeling"===

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I lay out all my reasons, you say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you say (stand by what you say)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

My friends say no-o, no-o-o
Then they don't know
No-o, no-o-o
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o
They don't know
No-o, no-o-o
No, no

And I say no, oh, oh

==="As It Was"===

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

==="Different World"===

All we know, left untold
Beaten by a broken dream
Nothing like what it used to be

We've been chasing our demons down an empty road
Been watching our castle turning into dust
Escaping our shadows just to end up here once more
And we both know

This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time

Broken smile, tired eyes
I can feel your longing heart
Call my name, howling from afar

We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat
Been building our castle just to watch it fall
Been running forever just to end up here once more
And now we know

This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time

Take me back
Back to the mountainside
Under the northern lights
Chasing the stars

Take me back
Back to the mountainside
When we were full of life
Back to the start
We both know that

This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time

==="Run"===

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run run run run run
Staring at the lights they look so pretty
Momma said "son son son son son
You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old
All that glitters don't turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run run run run run"

Yeah, run run run
Run run run

When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay pay pay pay pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last 3, 4, 5 days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy run run run run run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run run run

Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run run run

Run run run

Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let's have some fun, yeah
Run run run run run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run run run

Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all

Yeah 
Run run run

Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun

Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun

Yeah, if I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun, yeah, run run run

==="Good Thing"===

I booked myself tables at all the best restaurants then eat alone
I buy myself fast cars just so I can drive them real fucking slow
I like my own company, company I don't need it
I'm not always cold, I'm just good on my own, so good on my own

I've always been told, one day I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

I make myself up just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home
I pose and take pictures then send them to people that I don't know
I like getting compliments, compliments how I'm feeling, ooh
I'm not always selfish, just bad at romance, it's not in my bones

==="To Be So Lonely"===

Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don't blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit
I was away
And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch who can't admit when he's sorry

Don't call me "baby" again
You got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends
I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again
It's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

I just hope you see me
In a little better light
Do you think it's easy
Being of the jealous kind?
'Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You'll win
It's just a trick
And this is it, so I'm sorry

Don't call me "baby" again
You got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends
I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you, but I'm over it now

Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended

Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease

Sweet relief
Make me feel so (Pretty)
Would you help me out, please

Pretty
Pretty
Pretty
Pretty

I hate it, when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya and I need your love
When my mind is running wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
(Trickle down my spine, oh, you look so)
Pretty please
(Every single night)
I need your hands on me
(When your kisses climb, oh, you give me)
Sweet relief
Make me feel so (Pretty)
Would you help me out, please

Pretty please

==="this could be"===

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna second-guess
I'll make a mess of this
I never know just what I need
You come and make it clear
What to love and what to fear
You make it easy to be free

[Chorus]
I see you lying next to me
And I'm collecting memories
Oh, good, they'll never leave my brain
This could be better than I ever dreamed
Don't wanna understand
The purpose or the circumstance
I'm lucky just to know your name
This could be better than I ever dreamed

[Verse 2]
I'm lost but on my way
In love and out of place
All plans are making sense to me
Something about your mind
It keeps me out of mine
I tend to take myself too seriously

[Chorus]
I see you lying next to me
And I'm collecting memories
Oh, good, they'll never leave my brain
This could be better than I ever dreamed
Don't wanna understand
The purpose or the circumstance
I'm lucky just to know your name
This could be better than I ever dreamed

I see you lying next to me
And I'm collecting memories
Oh, good, they'll never leave my brain?
This could be better than I ever dreamed
Don't wanna understand
The purpose or the circumstance
I'm lucky just to know your name
This could be better than I ever dreamed

==="Paradise"===

One, two, three, four

Hands on your body
I'm grabbing your ass
Enjoying the moment
'Cause life move too fast
I'm looking forward, ignoring the past
These are the times that we'll laugh looking back
I'm getting lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters I'm wishing you well
This is my year man if you couldn't tell
This is our life and we're living it well

Late nights in the city causing hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit be like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive

But I swear I've never loved you more
With you right here I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)

I'm feeling it
My head's where the ceiling is (Oh yeah)
This energy
Turns nights into memories (Oh yeah)
Count up the bands, you've been working all summer
X didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another

Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny
This that shit you feel inside
This our life, our time, we living well

Late nights in the city causing hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right

==="The Heat"===

Take me down to your paradise
Won't believe until I see the light
Break me out, make me so alive
I'm craving you like I need a high

I'm a desert, you're an ocean
It's your motion that I need
But without you I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat

Take me down to your paradise
I lose my words every time I try
To make sense on why I lose my mind
You're every wrong that I need at night

I'm a desert, you're an ocean
It's your motion that I need
But without you I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat

But without you I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat

Without you I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat

==="Fallin' (Adrenaline)"===

Caught in the moment, not even thinkin' twice
Everything's frozen, nothing but you and I
Can't stop my heart from beating, why do I love this feeling?
Make me a promise, tell me you'll stay with me
If I'm bein' honest, I don't know where this leads
But that's the only question, baby, don't keep me guessin'

Ooh, you are my muse, I feel so reckless
Oh, you're makin' me, makin' me, makin' me give in

Oh, baby, I can feel the rush of adrenaline
I'm not scared to jump if you want to
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it
Maybe we'll just keep fallin'
I can feel the rush of adrenaline
I'm not scared to jump 'cause I want you
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it
Maybe we'll just keep fallin'

There's something about ya that's makin' me go insane
We have a storm to weather, my little sweet surrender

==="Wildest Dreams"===

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around
(Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
